The easiest way to get started - no building required!

```bash
npm install -g namecom-mcp
```

That's it! The package comes pre-compiled and ready to use.

## Configuration

### Prerequisites

You'll need Name.com API credentials:

1. Log in to your Name.com account
2. Go to Account Settings > API Access
3. Generate an API token
4. Note your username and the generated token

### Claude Desktop Setup (Recommended)

Add the following to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "namecom": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["namecom-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "NAME_USERNAME": "your-name-com-username",
        "NAME_TOKEN": "your-name-com-api-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**For Local Development** (if running from source):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "namecom": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/your/namecom-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "NAME_USERNAME": "your-name-com-username",
        "NAME_TOKEN": "your-name-com-api-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**For Production Environment** (advanced users):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "namecom": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["namecom-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "NAME_USERNAME": "your-name-com-username",
        "NAME_TOKEN": "your-name-com-api-token",
        "NAME_API_URL": "https://api.name.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Alternative: Environment Variables

If you prefer environment variables, create a `.env` file:

```env
NAME_USERNAME=your-name-com-username
NAME_TOKEN=your-name-com-api-token
# Defaults to test environment - uncomment and modify for production:
# NAME_API_URL=https://api.name.com
```

## Testing & Verification

### Method 1: Claude Desktop (Recommended for Daily Use)

**Claude Desktop provides the best experience** for using this MCP server. It's designed for natural conversation about domain management tasks.

1. **Install the package**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g namecom-mcp
   ```

2. **Configure Claude Desktop** (see Configuration section above)

3. **Start Claude Desktop**:

4. **Start using it naturally**:
   - Ask Claude domain-related questions like:
     - "Can you list my domains?"
     - "Search for available domains with the name 'example'"
     - "Show me the DNS records for my domain"
     - "Help me register a new domain"
     - "What environment am I using?"
     - "I'm having trouble with authentication"
   - Claude will ask for permission each time it tries to use a tool
   - The conversation flow feels natural and intuitive
   - **No need to learn commands** - just describe what you want to do!

### Method 2: MCP Inspector (For Testing & Development)

The MCP Inspector is **excellent for testing and debugging** during development, but Claude Desktop is better for actual domain management tasks.

1. **Install the MCP Inspector** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
   ```

2. **Run the Inspector**:
   ```bash
   # For NPM installation:
   npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx namecom-mcp
   
   # For local development:
   npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node "/path/to/your/namecom-mcp/dist/index.js"
   ```

3. **Open the Inspector**:
   - The command will output a local URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`)
   - Open this URL in your browser

4. **Test the Connection**:
   - Click "Connect" in the left sidebar
   - Make sure your setup shows the correct command and arguments
   - Once connected, click "List Tools" in the center
   - Select any tool to test that the endpoints are working through the MCP server

### Future: More AI Tools Coming Soon!

### Getting Help

The MCP server includes built-in help capabilities to assist you when things aren't working correctly:

#### üÜò Getting Help & Guidance
Simply ask me in natural language:
- **"Help me with Name.com"** or **"I need help with domain management"**
- **"I'm having trouble with Name.com"** or **"Something isn't working"**
- **"Show me some examples"** or **"What can I do with this?"**
- **"What environment am I using?"** or **"Am I in test mode?"**

#### üîó Support & Issue Reporting
When you need to report problems or get official support:
- **"How do I report an issue?"** or **"Where can I get support?"**
- **"I want to request a feature"** or **"How do I give feedback?"**
- **"Where's the documentation?"** or **"Show me the API docs"**

#### üåç Environment & Status Checks
To understand your current setup:
- **"What environment am I using?"** - Check if you're in test or production mode
- **"Am I in test mode?"** - Verify safety for experimentation
- **"Is it safe to experiment?"** - Get recommendations for your current environment

#### üí° The Key: Just Talk Naturally!
You don't need to memorize commands or tool names. Just describe what you want to do or what problem you're facing in plain English. The AI will:
- Understand your intent
- Use the appropriate tools behind the scenes
- Give you helpful information and guidance
- Connect you with the right support resources when needed

**These help capabilities work even if your API credentials aren't configured or if there are connection issues with Name.com's API!**

## Available Tools

The server dynamically generates tools based on the Name.com OpenAPI specification. Common tools include:

- `listDomains` - List domains in your account
- `getDomain` - Get details for a specific domain
- `searchDomains` - Search for available domains
- `createDnsRecord` - Create a new DNS record
- `listDnsRecords` - List DNS records for a domain
- `getAccountInfo` - Get account information
- And many more...

## Environment Information

- **Default Environment**: Test environment (`https://api.dev.name.com`)
- **Production Environment**: Available by setting `NAME_API_URL=https://api.name.com`
- **Safety**: Test environment operations won't affect real domains or incur charges

## Security Considerations

- **Never commit credentials**: Always use environment variables or Claude Desktop configuration
- **API Token Security**: Treat your Name.com API token like a password
- **Test Environment**: Default test environment provides safe experimentation
- **Least Privilege**: The server only accesses Name.com APIs with the permissions of your API token
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated using Zod schemas
- **Error Handling**: Errors are handled gracefully without exposing sensitive information

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Errors**: Verify your `NAME_USERNAME` and `NAME_TOKEN` are correct
2. **API URL Issues**: The tool defaults to test environment (`api.dev.name.com`)
3. **Tool Generation Fails**: The server will fall back to basic tools if OpenAPI spec loading fails
4. **Package Not Found**: 
   - Make sure you've installed the package: `npm install -g namecom-mcp`
   - Try reinstalling if you encounter issues: `npm uninstall -g namecom-mcp && npm install -g namecom-mcp`
5. **Claude Desktop Configuration Issues**:
   - Check your `claude_desktop_config.json` file path and syntax
   - Restart Claude Desktop after configuration changes
   - Verify the command is `npx` and args are `["namecom-mcp"]`
6. **MCP Inspector Connection Issues**:
   - For NPM installation, use: `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx namecom-mcp`
   - Check that your environment variables are set correctly

### Debug Mode

Set the environment variable `DEBUG=1` for verbose logging:

```bash
DEBUG=1 npx namecom-mcp
```

### Getting Help

If you run into issues:
1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Test with the MCP Inspector first to isolate configuration issues
3. Verify your credentials work with Name.com's API directly
4. Open an issue on GitHub with detailed error messages
